# appdirs Changelog

## appdirs 1.0.1 (not yet released)

Started this changelog 27 July 2010. Before that this module originated in the
[Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/komodo) product as `applib.py` and then as
[applib/location.py](http://github.com/ActiveState/applib/blob/master/applib/location.py)
(used by PyPM in [ActivePython](http://www.activestate.com/activepython)). This
is basically a dirty fork of applib.py 1.0.1 and applib/location.py 1.0.1.
